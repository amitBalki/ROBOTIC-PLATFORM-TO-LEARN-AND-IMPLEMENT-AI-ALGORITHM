**Introduction:-**

  Automatic path planning is one of the most challenging problems confronted by autonomous robots. Generating optimal paths for autonomous robots are some of the heavily studied subjects in mobile robotics applications. The aim of the project is to develop a rapid prototyping platform to run and test path planning algorithms. It uses overhead camera for 2D environment mapping, Bluetooth for wireless communication and the robot has calibrated PID controller for smooth trajectories. It overlooks the hardware complications and provides easy implementation for search algorithms.
